First
create
a list of strings
called colors
using the Arrays.asList() method
and print the original list elements.
To sort
the strings list alphabetically,
we use the sort method
on the colors list. The
lambda expression (str1, str2) ->
str1.compareToIgnoreCase(str2) is used as a comparator.
It compares two strings lexicographically,
ignoring the case,
using the compareToIgnoreCase method.
After sorting the list, we print the sorted list of strings.
